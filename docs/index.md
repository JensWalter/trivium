## the rules

### There exist only 3 types of object

* types
* bindings
* tasks

### There is no configuration - just code.

### All persistent data must exist typed.


## versioning

So lets start with version 0 - everything has to start somewhere.

Version 0 is set to timestamp 1444000000 (so Sun, 04 Oct 2015 23:06:40 GMT human time).

After that, the version increases constantly ever 2^21 seconds.
In the human world that would be about every 24 days.

So far there are no subversions. The criteria for defining an increment would be to cite the git commit hash (abbreviated version preferred).
